        <h4 class = "headers">My Meme Tier List Explained:</h4>
        <p class = "text">The <strong><em class = "important">Keanu Reeves</em></strong> meme started to gain popularity in 2019. It is number one because it <strong>can be used in any situation, truly <em>a diverese meme</em></strong>. The MashUp meme was difficult to place in 2nd place, but it had the <strong>classic <em class = "important">Gordon Ramsay meme</em></strong> which beat the John Tron meme, but only by a little. The John Tron meme is <strong>in 3rd place, but it is the most relatable</strong> of the bunch. During the begining of the pandemic this meme was used often to take toilet paper from the grocery store. However, this meme is starting to pop-up on the next gen console meme genere. Since the <strong>next gen consoles are <em>selling like hot cakes</em></strong> and bots are buying them, gamers use this meme often when trying to secure a PS5 or an X-Box Series X.</p>
